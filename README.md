This is an example of creating a 3D Engine, this is a very simple engine, but that well worked can put several effects, like the ones I put myself down.
-Turning color with each rotation in n degrees
-Fix a face at each rotation in n degrees
-Rotation on y-axis by 1 degree every second

Instructions:
Just place the catchy marcoandmislene3d.txt in the Pictures folder on your smartphone and run the code.
